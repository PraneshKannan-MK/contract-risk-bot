# Contract Analysis & Risk Assessment Bot

GenAI-assisted legal risk analysis platform for Indian SMEs.

---

## 🔍 Overview

The **Contract Analysis & Risk Assessment Bot** helps small and medium businesses understand complex contract documents by automatically extracting clauses, identifying legal risks, and presenting insights in simple, business-friendly language.

The system focuses on explainability, deterministic risk scoring, and practical usability for non-legal users.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

SMEs frequently enter into contracts without fully understanding:
- Unfavorable or unilateral clauses  
- Termination and liability risks  
- Compliance implications  

Manual legal review is costly and time-consuming. This project provides an automated, accessible alternative for early-stage contract risk assessment.

- Upload contract documents (PDF / DOCX)
- Perform clause-by-clause analysis
- Identify obligations, rights, and prohibitions
- Detect ambiguous and risky clauses
- Assign clause-level and overall risk scores
- Generate a clear risk summary report
- Refer to standard SME-friendly contract templates

- Weighted scoring is applied deterministically
- Configurable thresholds classify risk as:
  - **Low**
  - **Medium**
  - **High**
